# National Pet Rescue Platform

## Project Introduction

The National Pet Rescue Platform is a public welfare platform aimed at solving the problem of stray animals in society. It allows users to adopt animals and apply to become volunteers on the website. It also allows animal rescue centers to publish information about stray animals, approve and accept volunteers. 

This project has won the second prize in the National College Computer Design Competition and the second prize in the Henan Province Computer Design Competition.

Finally, we have decided to make it open source.
